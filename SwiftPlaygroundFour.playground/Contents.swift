//Part 6: Introduction to While Loops

var i = 1
while i <= 10
{
        //we want to print i
        print(i)
        //we want to add + 1 to i for each iteration through the loop
        i = i + 1
}

//Coding Challenge #1
var e = 1
while e <= 3
{
    //we want to print i
    print(e)
    //we want to add + 1 to i for each iteration through the loop
    e = e + 1
}

//Coding Challenge #2

for number in 1...10
{
    print(number)
}



var newSum = 0
for number in 1...10
{
    sum -= number
    print(sum)
}
